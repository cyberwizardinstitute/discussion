## Ant - website

<br> .? from Ant here, I'm building a website with 4 pages. About & Search, and 2 others that will be templates. One with search results (a table of resulting objects) and the other an item page (displays characters of a single chosen object). 
<br> .    What was suggested to me (but I don't know how to utilize) is
<br> .  node.js for packages and server communications.
<br> .  Express as a wrapper for packaging and structure.
<br> .  Jade for ease of html programming as well as replications and dynamism.
<br> .    If anyone here is experienced with these please let me know, if not I'll drop them and adapt to what is within our collective knowledge (Jade for example might be particularly obscure).
